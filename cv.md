##  **Briefly About Myself:**
Having entered the university in 2022, namely the Belarusian National Technical University, I began to think about who I could be. I chose the Faculty of Information Technology and Robotics, I was interested in the IT field.

 I started learning everything from the very beginning. I got a good basic knowledge of C++, Python. Everything seemed new and complicated to me. 
 
 In the summer of 2023, she completed an internship from the university at EPAM. I chose the Front-End direction. From the very beginning I had no idea what it was about, but gradually delving into my studies and the practice itself, I was dragged out. After practice, I decided for myself that I want to develop this direction and delve into this area. I Studied HTML And CSS. Next, the basics of JS.
 
  I am distracted from my main studies by creating websites, I like to do this and improve my knowledge. 
  
  Strengths: Perseverance, good perception of the material, interest in work, I like to learn new things. 
  
  Goals: To realize yourself as a Front-End developer.

{
    function alphabetPosition(text){
        const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
  const loweredStr = text.toLowerCase();
  let result = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < loweredStr.length; i++) {
    const char = loweredStr[i];
    const charIndex = alphabet.indexOf(char);

    if (charIndex !== -1) {
      const position = charIndex + 1;
      result += position.toString() + ' ';
    }
  }

  return result.trim();
